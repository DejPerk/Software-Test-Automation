How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
A way to ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure is through repetative testing, updating software to be able to cover possible data leaks and vunerablities, while also practciing secure coding guidelines. This minimizies the possible damages that can be caused through a lack of software vulnerabilities. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
There are a few ways to be able to interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program by first gathering all of the required data this way you are able to understand the type of software that is needed. Then from there planning out the steps and priortizing which features are going to take longer to work on versus the ones that wont will help with user usability preferences and performance. Repetitive testing will also help with usability and reliability. Then after each test collect the data to know where features need to be updated.  

How do I approach designing software?
Just like interpreting user needs and incorporating them, approaching designing software takes understanding the requirements from the stakeholders to be able to understand the software needs like both non functional and functional requirements. Then also building prototypes to be able to test and validate the design ideas while also taking notes and documenting the outcomes, the errors, and what necessary adjustments are needed.
